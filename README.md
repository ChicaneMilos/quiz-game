## Features

- **Quiz Creation and Management:** Allows the creation and management of the quizzes. Players can easily add, edit, or delete quizzes, as well as individual questions and answers. Each question can have up to 4 possible answers, with one designated as the correct answer. This flexibility allows for continuous updates and customization of quiz content.
- **Immersive Gameplay:** Players navigate through a 3D maze where questions are displayed on the screen. Each question is presented with four possible answers in the A, B, C, D format. Players must select the correct door that corresponds to the right answer to progress through the maze. This structure adds an interactive and challenging experience, while the LED-inspired visuals enhance the sense of exploration and mystery.
- **Score Summary:** At the end of the quiz, players are presented with feedback based on their performance. The game calculates and displays the player's score as a percentage of correct answers, providing immediate feedback on their success.
- **Easy Import and Export:** Quizzes can be easily imported and exported in JSON format, simplifying the process of sharing and managing quiz data.
- **Time Limit:** Players can set customizable time limits for completing quizzes. This feature adds an extra layer of challenge by requiring players to answer all questions within the specified time frame, with a visual countdown to track remaining time.
- **Ad Banners:** Customizable ad banners allow players to add dynamic images on the quiz walls. These banners can be used to enhance the game environment by including educational content, branding, or even promotional materials.

## Future Development

- **VR Compatibility:** The game will be fully playable in both VR and non-VR modes, enhancing the immersive experience.
- **Rewards System:** In future updates, rewards will be tied to the percentage score. Players who achieve higher percentages will receive better rewards. For VR users, these rewards will include virtual travel experiences, while non-VR users will have alternative rewards designed to enhance their gameplay experience.
